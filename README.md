## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

<img src="https://github.com/roy-mojica/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/images/multi_linear_reg.PNG">

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
